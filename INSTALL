HOTKEYS
-------
Hotkeys depends on the latest GNOME XML parser library version 2
(libxml2), get it from ftp://rpmfind.net/pub/libxml/ . More info on
its homepage at http://xmlsoft.org/ .

You also need the XOSD library if you want to enjoy the cool on-screen
display. It can be downloaded from http://www.ignavus.net/software.html

You also need libdb2, the Berkeley database library, but this is much
more common and most probably is already present in your system.

To compile the program, just type

        ./configure && make

You will get an executable file called 'hotkeys'.

To install, type

        make install
