NOTE: XML syntax of keyboard definition files has been changed in
version 0.5.6. Please consult sample.xml. Beware that there will be
at least one more XML syntax change in the future.

Requirements:
------------
 
* libxml, version 2.2.8 or later (http://xmlsoft.org/, ftp://xmlsoft.org)
* libdb3, the Berkeley v3 database library.
* You need the XOSD library (version greater than 1.0.0) if you want to
  enjoy the cool on-screen display, this is optional.  It can be
  downloaded at http://www.ignavus.net/software.html
* If you have GTK+ 2.0, you will have the bonus of a splash screen *grin*

For more info, please consult the manpage.
