TODO

- user configuration file

- Support  more  keyboard types, please e-mail me on this if you have a
  keyboard that's not yet supported.

- Support launching of applications  and  sleeping,  power down, etc.

- The cool OSD (on-screen display), I love eye candy :P

- A GUI for configuration, probably a GTK one, with Gnome integration.
  Later I may do for KDE too.

- Internationalization, gettextize it!

- RPM spec file, any one could give me a helping hand on this?
