TODO
----

My wishlist, in probably no specific priority order:

- Support  more  keyboard types, please e-mail me on this if you have a
  keyboard that's not yet supported.

- Support of devfs

- Support of ALSA (hardware mute)

- Multiple functionalities per key

- configure script should detect the correct version of libxml2
  (should have defined xmlChildrenNode)

- Support sleeping, suspend and power down (or logging out from WM).

- Run xscreensaver daemon on start-up (configurable)

- A GUI for configuration, probably a GTK one, with Gnome integration.
  Later I may do for KDE too.

- Internationalization, gettextize it!

- Documentation, should be done after the code is stabilized.

* Name change soon. Yes, a new name :)
