My wishlist, in probably no specific priority order:

- Support  more  keyboard types, please e-mail me on this if you have a
  keyboard that's not yet supported.

- Support launching of applications  and  sleeping,  power down, etc.

- The cool OSD (on-screen display), I love eye candy :P
  [Update: There is a library called XOSD which can be used, thanks
  Jeffrey Panczyk for telling me!]

- A GUI for configuration, probably a GTK one, with Gnome integration.
  Later I may do for KDE too.

- Internationalization, gettextize it!

- RPM spec file, any one could give me a helping hand on this?

- Make the program as a centralized hotkey ``organizor'' or
  ``dispatcher'' . What it means is best illustrated by an example.

  Suppose a program, say xmms, want to use hotkeys' functionality
  such that when the user presses the Play button, xmms will start
  playing, etc. Hotkeys can first make a Unix domain socket, such that
  xmms can "ask" hotkeys for "registration". Once the "registration"
  is successful, hotkeys will tell xmms so and hotkeys will inform
  xmms when the "registered" buttons are pressed.

  There may be more than one program that want to "register" for the
  same key, like the Eject key. In this case, resolution has to be
  done. Either first-come-first-serve or last-come-first-serve are
  acceptable behavior, so it's best left as a user configurable
  option.
