My wishlist, in probably no specific priority order:

- Support  more  keyboard types, please e-mail me on this if you have a
  keyboard that's not yet supported.

- Support launching of applications  and  sleeping,  power down, etc.

- The cool OSD (on-screen display), I love eye candy :P
  [Update: There is a library called XOSD which can be used, thanks
  Jeffrey Panczyk for telling me!]

- A GUI for configuration, probably a GTK one, with Gnome integration.
  Later I may do for KDE too.

- Internationalization, gettextize it!

- RPM spec file, any one could give me a helping hand on this?
