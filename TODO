My wishlist, in probably no specific priority order:

- Support  more  keyboard types, please e-mail me on this if you have a
  keyboard that's not yet supported.

- A configuration file (/etc/hotkeys.conf) to store settings like
  default keyboard, font size and colour of on-screen display, which
  program is the web browser and email client. This config file will
  be the usual name-value pairs:

    osd_colour=#10FF10
    osd_timeout=2
    web_browser=/usr/bin/mozilla

- Multiple functionalities per key

- configure script should detect the correct version of libxml2.

- Support sleeping, suspend and power down (or logging out from WM).

- A GUI for configuration, probably a GTK one, with Gnome integration.
  Later I may do for KDE too.

- Internationalization, gettextize it!

- Documentation, should be done after the code is stabilized.

* Name change soon. Yes, a new name :)
