hotkeys (0.5.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Corrected the configure script to be able to locate xml-config.
  * Include my own XF86keysym.h.
  * With splash screen!
  * Polypix and BTC 9000 keyboards.
  * debian/control: added libdb2-dev to Build-Depends, and
                    changed Standards-Version to 3.5.2.

hotkeys (0.5.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * The BadValue X protocol error is fixed, it's real! (Hence turned
    off the X synchronize mode, it's not needed any more) [major bug
    fix] (Closes: #85689)
  * Now you can specify the amount of volume increment and decrement
    in the keyboard definition file (1-100). [new]
  * Memorex MX1998 and MX2500 support. [new]
  * Check for both xml2-config and xml-config in configure.in
    (Closes: #87460)

hotkeys (0.5.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * #include db.h instead of db2.h [minor bug]
  * Added a --fix-vmware/-F option for using with VMware. Somehow
    VMware removes the action messages that I installed, so a thread
    is created to re-install it at a regular interval. A dirty hack...
  * Turns on the X synchronize mode, shouldn't have any performance
    issue as there's no GUI, but this can suppress the BadValue X
    protocol error.
  * Parsing of configuration file is changed: the global one will be
    parsed first and then the private one.

hotkeys (0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added SK-9925, SK-2800C, MS Natural Pro, Logitech Internet and
    Chicony KBP-8993 supprt. [new]
  * Inclusion of RPM spec. [new]
  * Unreadable definition files are processed correctly. [bug]
  * No more "zombie" processes left behind after launched applications
    quit. [bug]
  * Semantics of handling muting and volume changing is corrected
    such that failing to set one sound device won't affect the
    other. [bug]
  * Hope the BadValue X error is fixed... [bug] (Closes: #83064)
  * CDROM volume adjusting is now corrected [bug]

hotkeys (0.3.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed hardcoded paths of libxml from two #include, build
    on hosts that don't put header files in /usr/include/libxml
    should be correct now.
  * Added the `correct' URL on where to get libxml2.
  * The 'msnet' keyboard is actually the MS Internet Pro keyboard,
    renamed, and added the real MS Internet keyboard support.

hotkeys (0.3.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * User defined keys didn't function, fixed.
  * Temporary take out the Debian menu file as it's no use to start it
    without specifying the keyboard type.

 -- Anthony Wong <ypwong@debian.org>  Sat, 20 Jan 2001 05:19:53 +0800

hotkeys (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

    create their own preference now.

    exist a reasonable default.
  * Added SK-2500, SK-2501a, SK-7100, and Logitech cordless iTouch
    keyboard support.
  * Migrated from Imakefile to automake+autoconf.
