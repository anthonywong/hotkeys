hotkeys (0.5.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * #include db.h instead of db2.h [minor bug]
  * Added a --fix-vmware/-F option for using with VMware. Somehow
    VMware removes the action messages that I installed, so a thread
    is created to re-install it at a regular interval. A dirty hack...
  * Turns on the X synchronize mode, shouldn't have any performance
    issue as there's no GUI, but this can suppress the BadValue X
    protocol error.
  * Parsing of configuration file is changed: the global one will be
    parsed first and then the private one.

hotkeys (0.3.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed hardcoded paths of libxml from two #include, build
    on hosts that don't put header files in /usr/include/libxml
    should be correct now.
  * Added the `correct' URL on where to get libxml2.
  * The 'msnet' keyboard is actually the MS Internet Pro keyboard,
    renamed, and added the real MS Internet keyboard support.

hotkeys (0.3.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * User defined keys didn't function, fixed.

    without specifying the keyboard type.

hotkeys (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

    create their own preference now.

    exist a reasonable default.
  * Added SK-2500, SK-2501a, SK-7100, and Logitech cordless iTouch
    keyboard support.
  * Migrated from Imakefile to automake+autoconf.
