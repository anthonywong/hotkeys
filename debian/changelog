hotkeys (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Introduced an XML-based keyboard definition system; users can
    create their own preference now.
  * Now users must specify the type of keyboard, as there does not
    exist a reasonable default.
  * Added SK-2500, SK-2501a, SK-7100, and Logitech cordless iTouch
    keyboard support.
  * Migrated from Imakefile to automake+autoconf.
