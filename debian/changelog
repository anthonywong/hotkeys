hotkeys (0.5.7.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * configure.in: uses AM_PATH_XML2 that libxml2-dev provides, hopefully this
                  will solve the build problems on MIPS and MIPSEL.

hotkeys (0.5.7) unstable; urgency=low

hotkeys (0.5.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "one-version-to-merge-them-all", aka "maintainer-is-now-back", release

  * These account for NMU patches that I've merged:
    - acinclude.m4: check for libxml2 instead of libxml (Closes: #127987)
    - src/Makefile.am: added more SOURCES, put hotkeys.conf and splash.xpm
                       to EXTRA_DIST, use LIBXOSD variables in build
    - src/conf.c: initialize dbenv to NULL (Closes: #127987)
    - src/conf.c: changed action of Play from 'xmms --play' to 'xmms
                  --play-pause' (Closes: #162398, #136326)
    - src/hotkeys.c: modified function setKbdType such that user's definition
                     file is preferred over the global one (Closes: #135440)
    - configure.in: added AM_MAINTAINER_MODE, use AM_PATH_LIBXOSD (provided
                    by libxosd-dev) instead of my own AM_CHECK_LIBXOSD,
                    so disable configure arguments --with-xosd-inc and
                    --with-xosd-lib, check for libpthread
    - debian/control: Build-Depends: libxosd-dev (>= 1.0.3-1),
                      Conflicts: xmms (< 1.2.6-1)
    - debian/rules: in clean target, remove debian/debian and and make
                    distclean instead of make clean, should be more policy
                    compliant now
    - def/Makefile.am: add *.def to EXTRA_DIST
    - New key defs: hp5181 (Closes: #146029),
                    logitech-cfo (renamed from logitec-cho) (Closes: #149124),
                    kb9930 (Closes: #163212), orktekusb.def
    - Updated sk2500.def, leave keycode 151 untouched (Closes: #126334)
    - src/hotkeys.1 updated/corrected
    - src/hotkeys.conf: changed 'xmms --play' to 'xmms --play-pause'
    - Fixed all XOSD related bugs
      (Closes: #109007, #116820, #144659, #145041, #158843)
    - Thanks Junichi Uekawa (Closes: #162274, #164821), Bastian Blank, Michael
      Beattie and all bug reporters and "patchers" for your help and support =) 

  * These are my changes and additions:
    - debian/control: autoconf (>= 2.56)
    - New gtk+ code for the splash screen, modified Makefile.am and
      configure.in accordingly. (As gnome-utils in Gnome2 no longer contain
      the splash program, Closes: #145028)
    - Added <contributor> node in all *.def, modified src/kbddef.c
      accordingly.
    - New key defs: ibook, pb5140w

    off the X synchronize mode, it's not needed any more) [major bug
    fix] (Closes: #85689)

hotkeys (0.5.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * #include db.h instead of db2.h [minor bug]
  * Added a --fix-vmware/-F option for using with VMware. Somehow
    VMware removes the action messages that I installed, so a thread
    is created to re-install it at a regular interval. A dirty hack...
  * Turns on the X synchronize mode, shouldn't have any performance
    issue as there's no GUI, but this can suppress the BadValue X
    protocol error.
  * Parsing of configuration file is changed: the global one will be
    parsed first and then the private one.

 -- Anthony Wong <ypwong@debian.org>  Sat, 10 Feb 2001 04:48:35 +0800

    keyboard support.
