Description: A hotkeys daemon for your Internet/multimedia keyboard in X
 This program sits at the back and listens for the "special"
 hotkeys that you won't normally use on your Internet /
 Multimedia keyboards. The buttons perform their intended
 behaviors, such as volume up and down, mute the speaker,
 launch applications, etc.
 .
 It features an XML-based keycode configuration file format, which
 makes it possible to define the hotkeys to launch any programs you
 want.
