Description: A hotkeys daemon for your Internet/multimedia keyboard in X
 This program sits at the back and listens for the "special" hotkeys
 that you won't normally use on your Internet/Multimedia keyboards.
 The buttons perform their intended behaviors, such as volume up and
 down, mute the speaker, launch applications, etc. It has On-screen
 display (OSD) to show the volume, program that's being started, etc.
 .
 It features an XML-based keycode configuration file format, which
 makes it possible to define the hotkeys to launch any programs you
 want.
