hotkeys \- A hotkeys daemon for your Internet/multimedia keyboard in X
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hotkeys \-t \fIkeyboard_type\fR
[\fIoptions...\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program sits at the back and listens for the hotkeys on your
keyboard. The buttons perform their intended behaviors, such as volume
up and down, mute the speaker, launch applications, etc.
Theoretically, the functions they perform are programmable, but not
yet at the moment.

.P
As I have only the Acer wireless keyboard, you can help
me to support other keyboards by sending me the list of keycodes of
the hotkeys on your keyboard. You can do this by using \fBxev\fR.
Contact me for the details.
.SH "KEYBOARD DEFINITION FILES"
Keycodes and the behavior of the hotkeys are stored in a \fBKeyboard
definition files\fR. Each supported keyboard has such a file placed in
either \fI/usr/local/share/hotkeys\fR or \fI/usr/share/hotkeys\fR,
depending on the installation configuration. For instance, the data
of the Acer Wireless keyboard is stored in the file \fIacerwl.def\fR.
Note that the part of the filename without the extension is the name
you give to the \fB\-t\fR option.
.P
Keyboard definition files are in XML format, which should be
self-explanatory.
.P
You can create your own definition file and placed it in
\fI$HOME/.hotkeys\fR. Just take the file \fIdef/sample.xml\fR or an
existing definition file as an example.
.SH "NOTES"
Do not disable the XKEYBOARD extension. For XFree86 3.x, make sure
\fBXkbDisable\fR is not set.
.SH "TODO"
Please consult the TODO file.
.SH "BUGS"
.B
Please inform me if some of your normal keys lose functionalities
.B
after running hotkeys.
.PP
The program will sometimes terminate with the error
\fB"X Error of failed request:  BadValue (integer parameter out of range
for operation)"\fR at startup. I hope it's really fixed in v0.4.
.PP
APM support is highly experimental. I only tested on my desktop and
sometimes it can't go out from Suspend mode, no response from the
keyboard, mouse, nor the suspend button on the case. Not tested on
notebook (I don't have one). Note that you need root priviledge to use
the APM functions.
.PP
This is the first time I use autoconf, there are probably bugs in
the \fIconfigure.in\fR script.
